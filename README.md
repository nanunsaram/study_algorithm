# Study Algorithm

## What is this?
I will upload my own answers to well-known public beginner-level algorithm problems.

I run this repository to keep track of my skill development and also to encourage myself to work in a regular pattern. 

Everyone could feel free to use my codes, although I can guarantee neither accuracy nor efficiency.
